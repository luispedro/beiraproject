\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
In June and July 2010, Rita Reis and Luis Pedro Coelho, traveled to Mozambique
and taught theatre classes to high school students in four rural schools. Each
workshop was a week-long affair, with students working 1h30 per day.

Most of the students involved were already participating in school theatre
groups, which in the Mozambican context is closely linked to working as
volunteers for different organisations to spread information on topics such as
HIV/AIDS, other STDs, or education.

The classes were a mix of warm-up exercises for students (some of which formed
a core, repeated almost every day); text work, and improv work. In some cases,
there was interest in developing English language skills and some of the work
was done in English (some schools had English language theatre groups already,
organised by the Peace Corps\footnote{Peace Corps is a volunteering programme
of the American government.} volunteers).

The programme described here is the result of an evolution throughout our stay,
as we had the opportunity to work in different mission with two groups each
time. We were able to modify the presentation and exercises themselves as we
perceive them to be more or less successful (there were, of course, other
modifications that were made in response to the specificity of each group). We
describe our experience here in the hope that it will be useful to someone else
in the future.

\chapter{Introduction}
\chapter{Exercise Catalogue}
\section{Core}
\begin{itemize}
\item Spinal awakening,
\item spinal twists,
\item boom-cha-boom,
\item Oy, steady, take-it,
\item balance of the space.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Spinal Awakening}
\subsection{Spinal Twists}
\subsection{Boom Cha Boom}
This was adapted in every school to include the name of the school, followed by
Sofala (the province) or Mozambique. The main text ``We've got the rythm in our
hands|feet|hips|eyes'' was sometimes translated into Portuguese, sometimes not,
depending on the general level of the students.

\begin{verse}
Ma-chan-ga, boom-cha-boom\\
So-fa-la, boom-cha-boom\\
temos-o-rit-mo-nas-mãos/pés/ancas/olhos.

\subsection{Oy, steady, take-it}
This was adapted into Portuguese, as Oi-toma-espelho. An early attempt at using
the English version led to much confusion on part of the students.

\section{Improvs}

In some groups, improvs were in English (including at the request of the
students), sometimes it was in mixed language, sometimes we allowed them to use
an invented gibberish if they wished (but forbade Portuguese and
Ndau\footnote{Ndau is the local language. In truth, if the students chose to
speak Ndau, they would have been able to get away with it as neither of us
understood it.}). The students might not have always stuck to the rules, but
they did practice their English skills and some were much more fluent on stage
than when they were talking to the instructor.

Group improv settings were ``chapa'', health care centre, market, and party.

In Mozambique, a ``chapa'' is a 15-person minivan which serves as public
transportation carrying up to 20 passenger crammed into its seats. It is used
both in the city (where it is actually a very convenient way to get around as
the frequency is very high) and inter-city. The ticket collector, who also
calls out for passengers whenever the chapa stops (chapas stop on any
intersection as long as someone inside or outside calls out, but there are
semi-established stops), served as the leader in this improv. The stage started
with him alone on stage and he would call out to the rest of the group to join
him. When we had assembled a sufficient number of passengers, he'd call out for
a driver (this mimics the behaviour of actual chapas at terminal points when
the driver might step out for a little break as the ticket-collector gathers
new passengers). Other characters include salespersons, traffic police (who,
this being Mozambique, were willing for a bribe), the beggar, chapa owner, and,
in one inspired scene, the man ran over by the chapa. We describe it here at
length as it was invariably successful in terms of both including everyone,
being fun, and generating interesting scenes for the instructors watching.

\section{Group Text Work}



\subsection{Physicalise Verbs, Adjectives, or Important Words}

In a circle, each student will look for one verb and physicalise the
corresponding action. All of the other students will then imitate. We also
asked them to physicalise adjectives as a statue. Finally, we asked for
important keywords of the text which were physicalised.

\section{Individual Text Work}

Some of the exercises that were done as a group, can be repeated individually.
For example, physicaling verbs and adjectives can help the students find
appropriate action for their texts.

\subsection{Say it to a Partner}

Say the text to a partner on stage. This can be done in several variations:
face to face standing or sitting down, holding hands (this also helps to
contain the parasite hand gestures that some students possessed). The students
can be close or far apart.

Another variation is to say the text, back-to-back with a partner.

\subsection{Push the Wall}

Push against the wall, exerting force.

\subsection{Come Running from the River}

We asked the student to either run circling the room or to actually leave the
room, walk or run to a nearby and tree, then run back, barge in an say the poem
as if they had ran all the way from the river with this important message. This
should stimulate their feelings of urgency.


\section{Other Exercises}
\subsection{Object Transformation}
An object (such as a pencil-case) was passed around and pupils were asked to
make it as if it was something else (e.g., a mirror, a shoe,\dots). In some of
the classes, the remaining students would call out loud the name of the object
in English. This thus served as a vocabulary exercise.

\chapter{Challenges}
\section{Language}

Mozambique is home to many languages. In the region of Sofala where we were
working, Ndau is the most common language (Sena is also spoken in Sofala).
Portuguese is the official language of the country, but, particularly in the
country-side, some students only encounter it when they reach school age.
Therefore, their levels vary widely and some students struggle with vocabulary.

\section{Women's Position in Mozambican Society}

Mozambican society is highly patriarchal. This shows up both in the content
of the work (see below), but also in the way that women worked. In some groups,
there were very charismatic, talented female students, of course; but, on
average, the female students tended to be less self-confident and come forward
less.

In one occasion, a female student volunteered to play ticket-collector in the
``chapa'' improv, to which some of the male students reacted negatively saying
that a ``woman cannot be ticket-collector.'' This discouraged the girl and even
after we said that she could play the role, she was no longer interested.

\section{Mozambican Societal Issues}

Mozambican society had many problems which showed up again and again the
improvisation work. To some extent, this is the result of the role that theatre
plays in Mozambican society, very often focused on social issues; but it is
also a reflection of a society with many grave problems.

The corrupt traffic policeman was a staple of the chapa improv. In some cases,
he would ask for money directly, other times,the driver would offer it.

The women's position and relationship to sexuality and money was also
repeatedly portrayed as one of business. In the ``party'' improvisation,
seduction was often around the direct statement of ``I'm rich, I can buy you
presents'' (or conversely, ``I'm not interested. I already have a boyfriend and
he's rich.''). This pattern showed up even when we asked the students to play
switched genders. In another case, a woman was prostituted in the market with
one of the male students playing an intermediary who took a cut. These are all
issues that are present in Mozambican society, with many relationships between
men and women straddling the line between gift offering and outright
prostitution.

HIV/AIDS was present too. Not only where it was obvious (health care centre),
but everywhere (a condom salesman would show up and one ``market'' improv
included one thorough explanation of how to use a condom\footnote{In this case,
we actually appropriated this scene and re-fashioned it for the ``chapa''
improv, which was shown to the school.}). The students were all very
knowledgeable of the issues and, in a way that in the West would be very
surprising for their age, able to discuss it in front of others in a completely
matter-of-fact way.

Sometimes the students reacted against an overly negative portrayal of
Mozambique with the argument that they shouldn't only show the problems in
society but also that there are good things too. This led us to explore
alternative choices with the characters.

\chapter{Assets}
As well as challenges, Mozambicans had many assets when compared to Western
students of the same age.
