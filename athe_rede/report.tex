\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In July 2010, we worked with a group in Mozambique, Kufunana, which uses
theatre, particularly theatre of the oppressed, to reach out on HIV/AIDS
issues. We directed a show with their actors, a show we developed with them,
loosely based on Arthur Schnitzler's play ``La Ronde.'' We also took the
opportunity to talk to them and interview them about their work more generally.

In Mozambique, a very poor country, theatre is regularly used by many groups to
reach out with their social messages.

\chapter{Introduction}

\chapter{A Rede (The Network)}
La Ronde by Arthur Schnitzler is a play from 1900, set in Vienna. It is
structured as a series of encounters between a man and a woman such that the
character~1 meets (and has sex) with character~2, which then seen with
character~3. This continues until character~10 has a sexual meeting with the
first character, closing the loop (hence the name of the play). In each scene,
the actual sexual act is represented by a short blackout. The characters are
extracted from all of Austrian society, prostitutes, artists, noblemen,\ldots

One of the readings of the play is that the subtext is the transmission of
Syphilis, the venereal disease of the time through society.

After having learned from Mozambican society through discussions and talks, we
were reminded of Schnitzler's play. We described the basic concepts of
Schnitzler's La Ronde to the elements of Kufunana. We presented it not as a
goal (to perform an European play) but as a set of initial concepts for
discussion and asked for feedback. Some of the elements of Kufunana related it
to a recent concerted effort by HIV-related NGOs to make people aware of the
sexual networks of which they are a part of. Thus the idea developed from the
circle to the network.

We started work to develop these ideas into a show. All of our scenes emerged
organically through improvisation with the actors. After our initial discussion
setting the general guidelines, we had actors improvise over these themes.
Actors were not assigned roles at this stage and some themes (for example,
teacher and female student) were played by several actors. The actors had a
mandate to explore Mozambican themes and characters, but, beyond that, were
free to improvise.

In addition to on-stage work, we had discussions with the actors on whether the
piece represented Mozambican society and what was missing. For example, at one
point, we realized that we had a rich man, but no politically powerful figures
and this led us to add a member of parliament.

From La Ronde, we kept the structure that almost all of the scenes to be
partner scenes with a sexual encounter towards the end. We had characters from
all strata of society. While it does not make sense to have a count in modern
Mozambique, we had a member of parliament, and a rich business to represent the
ruling classes. The only character who is present in both versions is, perhaps
not surprisingly, the prostitute.

We had an imbalance in the distribution, with more male actors than female
actors. Partially for this reason, but also to introduce outside observers that
could comment on the actions of the other characters, we introduced what we
called a ``Greek chorus of drunkards.'' Their goals and actions were envisioned
to be similar to the Greek chorus (to foreshadow events, to tell the back story,
and to provide the \textit{vox popolis}), but to introduce a Greek chorus would
be a completely foreign element to Mozambican culture and would not be
understood by the audience. Therefore, we had the men of the chorus sit at a
bar, on one end of the stage, drinking and talking about the main actions
between the scenes. Their inebriation served as the naturalistic justification
for their frankness about everyone in the community.

For representing two of the sexual scenes, we developed a dance representation
of the sexual transmission of HIV. In one of these scenes, there is viral
transmission, in the other, one of the characters (the prostitute, who, as a
professional, always protects herself), wears a condom and is able to fight off
the infection. The scene was constructed by the actors and set to traditional
African drumming.

\chapter{Kufunana's Work}

Through our informal discussions with the members of Kufunana as well as
structured interviews\footnote{We are making some of the videos available, with
English subtitles, online at: http://beiraproject.org.} we were able to gather
information on their actions in the social sphere.

They are a cultural organization that focuses of HIV/AIDS. Their main artistic
focus is theatrical, but they also have musicians, plastic artists, and
artisans.

They often use theatre of the oppressed techniques in work places around the
city to attempt to get workers tested (or, if necessary, treated) for HIV and
provide counseling. This is actually one of their main sources of income as
companies will often pay for their services as they have now recognized that
keeping their employees in good health is in their best interests.

Additionally, they often travel to the country-side to do their work. Their
typical approach is to combine theatrical performances, theatre of the
oppressed, pure entertainment, and discussions.

\chapter{Conclusions}

In a collaborative effort, we adapted a century old play about \textit{fin de
siecle} Vienna to modern day Mozambique. As outsiders, we brought this idea to
the group, but let their responses organically mold the show as we would be
otherwise unable to create something that spoke to the community. As a side
effect of creating this show, we learned much about the structure of Mozambican
society, particularly its sexual economy, that the actors would portrait on
stage and which we would then follow up with discussions.

Theatre in Mozambique is used routinely to serve social goals.
