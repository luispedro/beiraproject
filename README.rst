=============
Beira Project
=============

These are actually three different projects, organised by directories:

a_rede
    This is the transcription of a collectively created show, loosely based on
    Schnitzler's `La Ronde <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Ronde_(play)>`__
athe_teaching
    This is a paper presented at ATHE 2011, which describes our efforts in
    using theatre in Mozambique.
athe_rede
    This was an alternative that could have been presented, but in the end, we
    felt that the other paper was more appropriate for that particular venue.
